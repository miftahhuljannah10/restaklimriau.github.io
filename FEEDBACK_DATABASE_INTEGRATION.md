# Feedback System Database Integration

## Overview
The feedback system has been successfully integrated to use dynamic data from the database instead of hardcoded questions. This allows administrators to manage feedback questions through the admin panel while the homepage dynamically displays these questions.

## Changes Made

### 1. HomeController Updates
- **File:** `app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `FeedbackQuestion` model import
  - Fetched active feedback questions with options in the `index()` method
  - Passed `$feedbackQuestions` to the homepage view

### 2. FeedbackQuestion Model Enhancement
- **File:** `app/Models/FeedbackQuestion.php`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `hasOptions()` method to check if question has dropdown options
  - Added `getTypeAttribute()` accessor to determine question type (text/dropdown)

### 3. Dynamic Feedback Component
- **File:** `resources/views/components/before-login/homepage/dynamic-feedback-button.blade.php`
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic rendering of questions from database
  - Support for both text input and dropdown questions
  - AJAX form submission
  - Automatic question type detection based on presence of options
  - Required field validation for first two questions
  - Responsive design with proper icons

### 4. FeedbackController Enhancement
- **File:** `app/Http/Controllers/FeedbackController.php`
- **Changes:**
  - Added JSON response support for AJAX requests
  - Maintained backward compatibility for non-AJAX requests

### 5. Homepage View Update
- **File:** `resources/views/masyarakat/index.blade.php`
- **Changes:**
  - Replaced static feedback component with dynamic component
  - Passed `$feedbackQuestions` data to the new component

### 6. Database Seeder
- **File:** `database/seeders/FeedbackQuestionSeeder.php`
- **Content:**
  - Question 1: Purpose of visit (text input, required)
  - Question 2: Information found (dropdown, required)
  - Question 3: Suggestions (textarea, optional)
  - Question 4: Website usability rating (dropdown, optional)

## Database Structure

### Questions Table
- `feedback_questions`: Stores question text, order, and active status
- `feedback_question_options`: Stores dropdown options for questions
- `feedback_responses`: Stores response sessions with IP tracking
- `feedback_answers`: Stores actual answers linked to questions and responses

### Question Types
- **Text Input**: Questions without options become text input fields
- **Dropdown**: Questions with options become dropdown selects
- **Textarea**: Last question automatically becomes textarea for longer responses

## Admin Management
The admin panel already includes full CRUD operations for feedback questions:
- Create/edit questions with text or dropdown types
- Manage dropdown options
- Toggle question active status
- View and manage feedback responses
- Bulk operations for response management

## Features

### Dynamic Question Rendering
- Questions are fetched from database on homepage load
- Question type determined by presence of options
- Required fields for first two questions
- Icons automatically assigned based on question position

### AJAX Form Submission
- Form submits via AJAX for better user experience
- Success/error messages displayed without page reload
- Form reset after successful submission
- Modal automatically closes on success

### Responsive Design
- Maintains original styling and animations
- Proper spacing and typography
- Mobile-friendly modal design
- Consistent with existing UI patterns

## Usage

### For Administrators
1. Access admin panel feedback questions section
2. Create/edit questions as needed
3. Add dropdown options for selection-type questions
4. Toggle questions active/inactive as needed
5. View submitted responses and analytics

### For Visitors
1. Click feedback button on homepage
2. Fill out dynamically loaded questions
3. Submit via AJAX (no page reload)
4. Receive confirmation message

## Testing
Run the seeder to populate initial questions:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=FeedbackQuestionSeeder
```

## Fallback Behavior
If no active questions are found in the database, the modal displays a friendly message indicating no questions are available, preventing broken user experience.
